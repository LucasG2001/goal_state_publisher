The use case should contain following activities to show the human robot collaboration:

1) The robot prepares the scene together with the human. The human gets spices while the robots gets the tools or vice versa
   (optionally implement logic to get one after the other, and move to the next if nothing is there)
   -> Safety bubble
2) Robot gets idle and into free flow mode. Wait until human has cut the veggies. The human then pushes the robot to get the robot to move to the bowl.
   -> smart impedance
   The human then debarasses the surface, while robot pours ingredients into pan. The robot puts down the dish near soap (and gets idle), which the human has to get
   to simultaneously, to spray the now empty table.
   -> safety bubble
3) Human gives robot another push, the robot starts cleaning the surface, while the human starts cooking
   -> Force control
